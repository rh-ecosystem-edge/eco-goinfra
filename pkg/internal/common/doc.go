// Package common provides a set of common functionality that can be used to reduce the boilerplate required for adding
// builders for new resources.
//
// The Builder interface is mainly for use within the common package and describes the methods that builders must
// implement to take advantage of the common functions. These common functions may be used to implement the typical CRUD
// methods of a builder.
